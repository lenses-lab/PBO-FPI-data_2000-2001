This is the set of all 20 PBO series datasets in a format that includes limited header information (specifically, no pointing information). 

Each series includes a 's#_observation.dat' file that is a compilation of all of the '*_d.out' files for each series. The 'd' in the filename refers to the final stage of data processing done by Dr. Ed Mierkiewicz. 

The dates included in each compilation file follow the JGR paper by Mierkiewicz et al. 2012. 

Zenith Distance Bin ("zdbin") and Galactic Longitude ("gallon") cuts have not been applied.
